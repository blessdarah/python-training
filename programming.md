* Solving problems
* Structured approach (algorithm)
* Finite set of steps (ordered)
* Efficient (Time, Space)
* Complexity
* Data structures (list, set, tupples, dictionaries, map, heaps, stacks)
* Progamming languages (low leve, high level)
* HLPL => Python, Js, PHP, C# ... 
    - Closer to human languages
    - Compiled, Scripting
    - Compiler and Intepreter
    - Compiler => compiled languages
    - Intepreter => Scripting languages

## Compiled and Scriptiong languages
* Evaluated before executed by a compiler.
* Ensures that it adhers to program design and structure.
