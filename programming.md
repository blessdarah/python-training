* Solving problems
* Structured approach (algorithm)
* Finite set of steps (ordered)
* Efficient (Time, Space)
* Complexity
* Data structures (list, set, tupples, dictionaries, map, heaps, stacks)
* Progamming languages (low leve, high level)
* HLPL => Python, Js, PHP, C# ... 
    - Closer to human languages
    - Compiled, Scripting
    - Compiler and Intepreter
    - Compiler => compiled languages
    - Intepreter => Scripting languages

## Compiled and Scriptiong languages
* Evaluated before executed by a compiler.
* Ensures that it adhers to program design and structure.



## Conditionals
* check Conditionals
if a condition works then we can do something
if not workings we can do another (else do another thing)
check if something is true or false
skip sections of our code

if(backfrom school):
    dish your food
    end;
    
your not not back from school
